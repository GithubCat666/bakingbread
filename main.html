                <h3>Pandesal</h3>
                <div class="recipe-details">
                <p>Ingredients: 
                    3 cups all-purpose flour - see NOTE 1 about bread flour
                    ¼ cup sugar
                    1 teaspoon salt
                    1 cup milk - lukewarm
                    1 egg
                    2 tablespoon butter - melted (or margarine)
                    1 ½ teaspoon instant dry yeast - see Note 2
                    ¼ cup breadcrumbs
                </p>
                <p>Instructions: In a big bowl, mix together flour, sugar, salt. 
                    Pour in milk, beaten egg and melted butter. Mix several times until well blended. Make sure that the milk is only mildly warm and not hot. 
                    Add the instant dry yeast and fold until a sticky dough forms.
                    Tip the dough on a floured surface and knead until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 5-10 minutes.
                    Form the dough into a ball and lightly coat with oil. Place it in a bowl and cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place it in a warm area and let it rise until it doubled in size. Depending how warm it is, could take 30 minutes to an hour.
                    Punch down the dough and divide into 2 equal parts using a knife or dough slicer. Roll each into a log. Cut each log into 6 smaller pieces. 
                    Shape each piece into a ball and roll it in breadcrumbs, completely covering all sides.
                    Arrange the pieces on a baking sheet leaving some gaps in between (at least an inch). Leave them to rise second time until double in size.
                    While waiting, preheat oven 370° F /185°C. Bake the Pandesal for 15 minutes or until the sides are a bit browned.
                    Remove from oven and serve while hot!

                <h3>Ensaymada</h3>
                <div class="recipe-details">
                <p>Ingredients: 
                    1 cup milk
                    ⅓ cup sugar
                    ½ cup shortening -softened to room temperature
                    1 envelope active dry yeast (about 7-9 grams (¼ oz) or 1 tablespoon) - proofed in ¼ cup warm water ( See Note 1 for alternative)
                    3 ½ cup flour
                    3 egg yolks
                    ¼ tablespoon salt
                    ¼ cup butter - softened to room temperature- for brushing
                    TOPPINGS
                    ½ cup butter - softened to room temperature
                    ½ cup powdered sugar
                    1 cup Kraft cheese or other grated cheese
                </p>
                <p>Instructions: In a mixing bowl, mix together milk, shortening, sugar and salt.
                    Add half of the flour and the bloomed yeast and mix for 3-5 minutes at medium speed until a paste-like consistency is achieved.
                    Add the egg yolks and the rest of flour and mix for another 3 minutes. Add more flour if the mixture is too liquid or too sticky but not too much.The dough is supposed to be sticky.
                    Scrape the sides while folding the dough in the middle of the bowl and then cover with kitchen towel. Let it rest and rise in a warm place for 2-3 hours or until it doubled its size.
                    Scrape the sides of the bowl while tipping the sticky dough over to the thinly floured working surface.
                    Roll the dough into a log and cut into 2. Roll each log again and cut into 2. Repeat this process until you end up with 16 slices.
                    Using a rolling pin, roll a slice into a rectangle (about 8x4 inch) and brush the surface with softened butter. Roll it from one end of the long side to the other end, creating a long, thin log then shape it into a coil (spiral) with the end tucked under.
                    Place each coiled dough in a greased mold and let it rest in a warm place for about 30 minutes to 1 hour until it has risen to almost double its size.
                    Bake them in a preheated oven at 300°F /150°C for 20-25 minutes. Once baked let them cool down for a few minutes before removing from molds.Then let them cool completely.
                    Meanwhile, prepare the buttercream by creaming ½ cup of softened butter and ½ cup powdered sugar.
                    Using a knife or spoon, cover the top of the ensaymadas with buttercream and lastly with a generous amount of grated cheese.

                <h3>Monay</h3>
                <div class="recipe-details">
                <p>Ingredients:
                    4 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour
                    ½ cup milk powder
                    ⅔ cup sugar
                    ½ teaspoon salt
                    ¾ cup lukewarm water adjust as needed
                    1 teaspoon instant yeast
                    ¼ cup unsalted butter or margarine softened to room temperature
                    1 medium egg
                    2 tablespoons milk/evaporated milk for brushing
                </p>
                <p>Instructions: 4 cups bread flour,½ cup milk powder,⅔ cup sugar,½ teaspoon salt
                    Combine bread flour, mik powder, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl and mix until well distributed. Make a well in the center.
                    ¾ cup lukewarm water,1 teaspoon instant yeast
                    Pour lukewarm water in the "well" then sprinkle the instant yeast over the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir the water to moisten the yeast.
                    ¼ cup unsalted butter or margarine,1 medium egg
                    Add the softened butter and egg then slowly mix the rest of the flour mixture with the liquid to create a dense dough.
                    Knead for 8-10 minutes until the dough becomes very smooth and elastic. If the dough is too dry when you start to knead add a bit more water, a tablespoon at a time then knead to check again.
                    Shape the dough into a ball and then place it in a greased bowl, cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 1 hour in a warm place.
                    Transfer the dough onto a flat surface and fold and knead 1-2 times just to release the air. Shape into a log then divide into 4 equal parts. Shape them into balls and let them rest for 5-10 minutes. Take a ball and cut it into halves. Now shape each half into a smooth ball. Repeat with the rest making 8 balls in total.
                    Arrange the balls on a baking tray. Using a sharp knife or blade, make one deep cut (about half of the height of the dough) across the middle of each balled dough. Cover with a tea towel and let it rest again for 30 minutes or until it has risen a bit and the cuts have opened up..
                    Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C/350°F for 15 minutes for a light brown top or 20 minutes for a golden brown top.
                    2 tablespoons milk/evaporated milk
                    Once done, take it out from the oven and lightly brush with milk while hot. It will absorb the milk and become a little shiny.</p>

                <h3>Pan de Coco</h3>
                <div class="recipe-details">
                <p>Ingredients: 
                    2 cups all-purpose flour
                    ⅓ cup sugar
                    ¼ teaspoon salt
                    1 teaspoon instant dry yeast
                    ¾ cup lukewarm milk
                    ¼ cup vegetable oil
                    ½ cup water
                    2 tablespoons butter
                    ½ cup brown sugar unpacked
                    1 ½ cup fresh grated coconut
                    1 teaspoon vanilla extract -optional
                    1 small egg
                    1 tablespoon water</p>
                <p>Instructions: 2 cups all-purpose flour,⅓ cup sugar,¼ teaspoon salt,1 teaspoon instant dry yeast
                    In a large bowl, sift together the flour and sugar, and salt. Then sprinkle the instant dry yeast and mix.
                    ¾ cup lukewarm milk,¼ cup vegetable oil
                    Add the wet ingredients. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, mix until it forms a dough.
                    Turn the dough on a flat surface and knead. If it is too wet or sticky, apply some oil to your hands and on the surface to prevent the dough from sticking. If it is too dry, add some more oil to the dough. As you continue kneading, the dough should be less and less tacky and easier to handle. Try not to add more flour as this might result in dense rolls. It may take you as fast as 7 minutes or longer depending on different factors. Perform the windowpane test to be sure.
                    Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Leave it to rise for 30 minutes to an hour or until it has almost doubled its size.
                    FILLING
                    ½ cup water,2 tablespoons butter,½ cup brown sugar
                    While waiting, prepare the filling. In a pan over medium heat, bring water to a boil. Add butter and add brown sugar and let it simmer until it starts to thicken.
                    1 ½ cup fresh grated coconut,1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                    Add the grated coconut and cook for some minutes until all the syrup is absorbed. Remove filling from heat and allow to cool down.
                    Forming and Assembly
                    Gently punch down the dough to deflate. Tip it over to a flat surface. Shape the dough in a rectangle and cut it lengthwise in 3 equal parts. Then crosswise in 4 equal parts, making 12 pieces in total. Shape each piece into a ball. Once done, cover the dough pieces with a kitchen towel and let them rest for at least 3-5 minutes.
                    Flatten each dough with the palm of the hand. Hold the flattened dough in the curve of your palm and add about 1 tablespoon of coconut filling in the center.
                    Pinch the corners together to fully enclose the filling and roll it in between your palms to make them round again.
                    Arrange the filled dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper 1 inch apart. Slightly press the buns to flatten a bit.
                    Using a fork, poke small holes in the center of each filled dough. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let them rest for another 20-30 minutes or until it doubles in size.
                    Egg Wash
                    1 small egg,1 tablespoon water
                    Combine 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of water and beat until frothy. Set aside.
                    Baking
                    Bake in a preheated oven at 170°C/325°F for 10 minutes. Take the baking pan with the buns from the oven and brush with egg wash. Return to oven and bake for another 5 minutes or until the buns turn golden brown.
                    Remove the buns from the oven and let them cool down a bit before serving. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or tea.

                <h3>Spanish Bread</h3>
                <div class="recipe-details">
                <p>Ingredients: 
                    3 cups all-purpose flour
                    1 ½ teaspoons instant yeast - see NOTE 1
                    ¼ cup white sugar
                    1 teaspoon salt
                    ¾ - 1 cup lukewarm milk - see NOTE 2
                    3 tablespoons butter - or margarine, melted

                    FOR FILLING
                    ¼ cup butter
                    ½ cup bread crumbs
                    2 teaspoons flour
                    ⅛ cup water or milk - or more see NOTE 3
                    ½ cup brown sugar /white sugar
                    ⅛ teaspoon salt
                    butter - for brushing
                    FOR BREADING
                    2 tablespoons milk - or water
                    ½ cup bread crumbs</p>
                <p>Instructions: In a big bowl, mix together flour, sugar, and salt. Pour in lukewarm milk, melted butter, and beaten egg. Mix until well blended. Add the instant yeast and mix well to form a slighly sticky dough.
                    Tip the dough on a surface greased with oil. Knead the dough with lightly oiled hands until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 10-12 minutes.
                    Form the dough into a ball and place the dough in a greased bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place it in a warm area and let it rise until it doubled in size. Depending on how warm it is, could take 30 minutes to an hour or even longer.
                    Meanwhile, prepare the filling. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter until bubbly. Add the ¼ cup bread crumbs and mix well. Add flour, water or milk, sugar, salt and rest of breadcrumbs. Cook until it gets thick. Remove from heat and continue stirring until it forms a thick paste-like texture.
                    Punch down the dough and divide into 16 equal parts using a knife of dough slicer. Roll each piece into a long triangle (like a pizza slice). Brush the middle part with butter or margarine then spread filling on the surface leaving about a centimeter around the edges unfilled. Roll the dough starting from the wider end towards the smaller end enclosing the filling.
                    Brush each rolled dough with milk or water then roll it on a plate of breadcrumbs and place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper: make sure that the end part sits at the bottom so it won't open up while baking. Cover with cloth or kitchen towel or cling wrap and let them rise for another 20-30 minutes or until they doubled in size. Remove cover before baking.
                    Place the baking sheet on the middle rack and bake at 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes.
                    Remove the Spanish bread from the oven and transfer to a bread basket. Enjoy while still warm.</p>

                <p>Ingredients: 
                    For greasing the pan
                    ½ cup lard or shortening
                    2 tablespoons oil
                    3 tablespoons flour
                    For making the batter
                    2 large eggs
                    1 can evaporated milk 370ml
                    ¼ teaspoon salt
                    1 ¼ cups sugar
                    ⅔ cup vegetable oil or coconut oil
                    1 teaspoon vanilla
                    3 cups all-purpose flour
                    3 teaspoons baking powder
                    Yellow food color
                </p>
                <p>Instructions: 
                    ½ cup lard,2 tablespoons oil,3 tablespoons flour
                    In a small bowl, combine lard/shortening, oil, and flour. Mix well until fully blended.
                    Use the above mixture to generously grease 2 12-cup muffin pans. Set aside. The cups should be thickly coated as this helps form a unique shape (like a salakot) aside from the baking method later on.
                    Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C for fan /400°F.
                    2 large eggs,1 can evaporated milk,¼ teaspoon salt,1 ¼ cups sugar
                    In a large bowl, add the eggs and beat. Then add the milk, salt, and sugar. Mix until the sugar is dissolved.
                    ⅔ cup vegetable oil,1 teaspoon vanilla
                    Add oil and vanilla. Mix until well incorporated.
                    3 cups all-purpose flour,3 teaspoons baking powder
                    Sift in the flour and baking powder. Mix well using a whisk or an electric mixer. The batter should not be too thick, you want a batter that is smooth and makes continuous ribbons when from the whisk or spatula when lifted. If too thick, add some water.
                    Yellow food color
                    Add some drops (about ¼ teaspoon) of yellow food color and mix again just until well incorporated.
                    Pour the batter over your prepared pan, about ¾ full.
                    Bake in the preheated oven at 200°C for about 3-5 minutes or until the edges rise up, creating a crater in the middle. Then turn the heat down to 160°C and bake for another 10 minutes fully baked, do the toothpick test. You’ll notice that the middle part will rise after some minutes and create a dome, forming the salakot.
                    Remove the muffin pans from the oven. Let cool down a bit in the pan until cool enough to handle.               
                    Transfer to a serving tray.

                <p>Ingredients: 4 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour
                    ½ cup milk powder
                    ¾ cup sugar
                    1 teaspoon salt
                    ¾ -1 cup lukewarm water
                    1 teaspoon instant yeast
                    ¼ cup unsalted butter or margarine softened to room temperature
                    1 large egg
                    1 Tbsp milk
                    Sugar for topping
                </p>
                <p>Instructions: Combine bread flour, mik powder, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl and mix until well distributed. Make a well in the center.
                    Pour in ¾ cup lukewarm water then sprinkle the instant yeast over the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir the water to moisten the yeast.
                    Add the softened butter then slowly fold in the rest of the flour mixture with the liquid to create a dense dough.
                    Knead for 7-10 minutes until the dough becomes smooth. If the dough is too dry when you start to knead add a bit more water, a tablespoon at a time then knead to check again. Do NOT add too much water. The dough has to be dense, it will not be elastic but it should be smooth.
                    Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 1 hour in a warm place.
                    Divide the dough into 20 pieces or about 50 grams each. Shape them into balls and arrange them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
                    Using a kitchen scissor, snip the top with 2 intersecting lines to form a cross. Cover with a tea towel and let it rest again for 30 minutes. Expect that they will not rise much.
                    Brush each piece with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180°C/350°F for 18-20 minutes or until top becomes golden
                    Take the star bread from the oven and transfer them to a bread basket or plate and enjoy with a cup of hot beverage.

                <div class="recipe-details">
                <p>Ingredients:

                </p>
                <p>Instructions: In a saucepan, add milk and stir in the sugar, heat the milk until warm (just enough that you can touch it). Then add the yeast powder and mix. Set aside and let the yeast activate for about 10 minutes.
                    In a mixing bowl, add the dry ingredients. (Flour, salt, and baking powder). Once the yeast is activated (the mixture becomes frothy). Add it to the prepared dry ingredients in the bowl and blend it with the electric mixer
                    Add egg, butter and blend with a mixer for 20 minutes or just manually knead it with hands until it becomes elastic.
                    Transfer into a bowl and cover with a dry cloth/towel. Let it rise for 1 hour.
                    After an hour, knead it again for a short time. Then, slice the dough in half. Form two logs and divide it in small equal round pieces.
                    Transfer it into a cupcake tray and let it rest for another 30 minutes and cover it with a dry towel.
                    Preheat the oven at 160°C for 10 minutes. Then, brush the top of each dough with room temperature butter.
                    Bake it for about 15-20 minutes. Once done, remove the tray from the oven and brush each bonete with milk on top.
                    Serve and enjoy!
